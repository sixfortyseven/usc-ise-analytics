# USC Course Cheatsheets

Community-maintained study notes and cheat sheets for USC courses across schools and departments (Viterbi, Dornsife, Marshall, Annenberg, and more). Open to students, alumni, TAs, and instructors.

## Repository Structure
- Top-level folders by course key (e.g., `ise529`, `csci570`, `ee450`, `math225`).
- Inside each course, content is organized by instructor and term:
  - `ise529/victoria-stodden/2024spring/`
  - `ise530/andres-gomez-escobar/2024fall/`
  - `ise535/bruce-wilcox/2025spring/`
  - `ise543/bruce-wilcox/2025spring/`
  - `ise547/mayank-kejriwal/2025fall/`
  - `ise558/carl-kesselman/2024spring/`

Course directories that don’t yet have instructor/term folders are welcome for contributions.

## Current Contents (Examples)
- `ise529/victoria-stodden/2024spring/`

## Getting Started
- Browse into a course folder (e.g., `ise529/`), then into the appropriate `instructor/term` folder.
- Each `instructor/term` folder includes a local `README.md` with course name, instructor, and term.

## Contributing
- Issues and PRs are welcome. Keep content within the appropriate course folder.
- Avoid sharing graded solutions, proprietary materials, or sensitive data. Follow USC’s academic integrity policies.
- New content should be added under `course-key/instructor-slug/termyear/`.

### Naming Conventions
- `course-key`: lowercase subject + number (no spaces). Examples: `csci570`, `ee450`, `chem105a`, `ise529`.
- `instructor-slug`: lowercase, hyphenated full name (e.g., `victoria-stodden`, `andres-gomez-escobar`).
- `termyear`: four-digit year + lowercase term, no separator (e.g., `2024spring`, `2024fall`, `2025spring`).
- Example: `ise529/victoria-stodden/2024spring/`.

### Required Subfolder README
Each `instructor/term` folder should include a `README.md` containing at minimum:
- Course: e.g., `ISE 529 — Predictive Analytics`
- Instructor: Full name
- Term: e.g., `2024 Spring`

You can copy `SUBFOLDER_README_TEMPLATE.md` as a starting point.
